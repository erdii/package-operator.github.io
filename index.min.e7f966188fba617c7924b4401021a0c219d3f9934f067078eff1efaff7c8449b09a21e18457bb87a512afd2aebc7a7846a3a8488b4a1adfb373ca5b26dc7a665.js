(in this order)
Security # A Kubernetes package manager is entrusted with a very high level of permissions on one or multiple clusters and also works with secrets as part of package configuration. Without putting security of these credentials first, users will not be able to trust Package Operator.
Stability # Stability enables any other feature in the Package Operator and makes or breaks it\u0026rsquo;s whole value proposition. Because many day-2 operations, like patching, updating and re-configuration can be orchestrated via Package Operator, a miss-behaving or broken Package Operator can spell doom to any production environment.
Package Operator commits to stability and extensive automated testing for any feature being implemented.
Transparency # Stability is never absolute, so it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to be transparent.
Transparency enables users of the Package Operator to debug and resolve issues, with either their own workloads or the Package Operator itself, in a timely and sane manner.
Extensibility # The Kubernetes ecosystem is moving fast, really fast.
New Operators, APIs, procedures and tools are being created at an astounding pace.
Package Operator tries to be plug-able, allowing users to use any kind of custom resource registered on the Kubernetes cluster. Facilities of Package Operator are also setup to be overridden, so they can be switched for custom or alternative implementations.

These new APIs can be interacted with like any other Kubernetes object using e.g. kubectl.
APIs follows the same API versioning guidelines as the main Kubernetes project.
Versioning principles. Taken from the Kubernetes API versioning documentation:
Alpha
The version names contain alpha (for example, v1alpha1). The software may contain bugs. Enabling a feature may expose bugs. A feature may be disabled by default. The support for a feature may be dropped at any time without notice. The API may change in incompatible ways in a later software release without notice. The software is recommended for use only in short-lived testing clusters, due to increased risk of bugs and lack of long-term support. Beta
The version names contain beta (for example, v2beta3). The software is well tested. Enabling a feature is considered safe. Features are enabled by default. The support for a feature will not be dropped, though the details may change. The schema and/or semantics of objects may change in incompatible ways in a subsequent beta or stable release. When this happens, migration instructions are provided. Schema changes may require deleting, editing, and re-creating API objects. The editing process may not be straightforward. The migration may require downtime for applications that rely on the feature. The software is not recommended for production uses. Subsequent releases may introduce incompatible changes. If you have multiple clusters which can be upgraded independently, you may be able to relax this restriction. Stable
The version name is vX where X is an integer. The stable versions of features appear in released software for many subsequent versions. package-operator.run/v1alpha1 # The package v1alpha1 contains API Schema definitions for the v1alpha1 version of the core Package Operator API group, containing basic building blocks that other auxiliary APIs can build on top of.
ClusterObjectSet ClusterObjectSetPhase ObjectSet ObjectSetPhase ClusterObjectSet # ClusterObjectSet reconciles a collection of objects through ordered phases and aggregates their status.
ClusterObjectSets behave similarly to Kubernetes ReplicaSets, by managing a collection of objects and being itself mostly immutable. This object type is able to suspend/pause reconciliation of specific objects to facilitate the transition between revisions.
Archived ClusterObjectSets may stay on the cluster, to store information about previous revisions.
A Namespace-scoped version of this API is available as ObjectSet.

While revision are ordered on a time axis, Package Operator makes no assumptions on the contents of each revisions. This means that Revision 3 could contain the same spec as Revision 1, rolling back changes introduced by Revision 2.

Rollout Handling # Depending on the contents of the new revision, objects are eventually either:
Patched
If the object still part of the new revision, it will be handed over to the next revision. Deleted
If the object is not part of the new revision, it will be deleted when the old revision is archived.

When all objects have been handed over to a new revision, the previous revision is automatically archived.

If the Update fails, your deployment may face downtime.

An old and a new revision.
If a revision fails to become available due to e.g. misconfiguration and a new revision supersedes it, multiple intermediate revisions might be active until the latest revision becomes available.
Intermediate revisions will only be Cleaned up if:
Latest revision becomes available Revision is not reconciling any objects anymore Latest revision is not containing any object still actively reconciled by an intermediate This behavior is necessary, so Package Operator can ensure the safe handover of objects between revisions. In the example above, the ConfigMap \u0026ldquo;my-config\u0026rdquo; is handed over from revision 1 to revision 2 and in the end to revision 3.
As soon as revision 3 takes ownership of the ConfigMap, the failed intermediate revision 2 can be archived, as \u0026ldquo;my-deployment-v2\u0026rdquo; no longer exists in revision 3 and is thus save to delete.
